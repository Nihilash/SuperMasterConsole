# 🎓 SuperMasterConsole
### A Role-Based Student Academic Management System (Console-Based, Core Java)

Hi there 👋!  
I'm **Nihilash L V**, and this is one of the most exciting projects I’ve built using **Core Java** — a **console-based role-driven student marks management system** that simulates real-world academic data handling in a university environment.

---

## ✨ Why I Built This Project

As someone passionate about **Java development and software testing**, I wanted to create something more than a typical CRUD app.  
So I imagined a system inspired by how real **engineering colleges** like Anna University manage marks, grades, and revaluation. The result is **SuperMasterConsole** — a project where I applied concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming**, **role-based access**, **modular architecture**, and clean code practices.

## 💡 What is SuperMasterConsole?

It’s a **console-based application** with different dashboards and access controls for:

- 👨‍🎓 **Students** – who can view their semester marksheet and apply for revaluation  
- 👩‍🏫 **Staff Members** – who can add new students, add subjects, update marks, and view revaluation requests

This project is modular, scalable, and built from scratch using only **Core Java (JDK 17)** — no external libraries or databases (yet!).

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Skills Used

- 💻 **Language**: Java 17  
- 💡 **Architecture**: Modular & layered  
- 🎯 **Concepts**: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Interface)  
- 🧠 **Design Style**: Role-based dashboards with clean class separation  
- 🗂️ **Storage**: In-memory (using collections)
