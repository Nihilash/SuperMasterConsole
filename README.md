#  SuperMasterConsole
### A Role-Based Student Academic Management System (Console-Based, Core Java)

Hi there !  
I'm **Nihilash L V**, and this is one of the most exciting projects I’ve built using **Core Java** — a **console-based role-driven student marks management system** that simulates real-world academic data handling in a university environment.

---

##  Why I Built This Project

As someone passionate about **Java development and software testing**, I wanted to create something more than a typical CRUD app.  
So I imagined a system inspired by how real **engineering colleges** like Anna University manage marks, grades, and revaluation. The result is **SuperMasterConsole** — a project where I applied concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming**, **role-based access**, **modular architecture**, and clean code practices.

##  What is SuperMasterConsole?

It’s a **console-based application** with different dashboards and access controls for:

- **Students** – who can view their semester marksheet and apply for revaluation  
- **Staff Members** – who can add new students, add subjects, update marks, and view revaluation requests

This project is modular, scalable, and built from scratch using only **Core Java (JDK 17)** — no external libraries or databases (yet!).

##  Tech Stack & Skills Used

-  **Language**: Java 17  
-  **Architecture**: Modular & layered  
-  **Concepts**: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Interface)  
-  **Design Style**: Role-based dashboards with clean class separation  
- **Storage**: In-memory (using collections)

##  Learning Outcomes

By working on SuperMasterConsole, I strengthened my grip on:
- Structuring real-world Java applications  
- Implementing encapsulation and clean method separation  
- Designing user role access in a console-based project  
- Debugging large-scale console programs  
- Preparing for Java backend and software testing interviews
